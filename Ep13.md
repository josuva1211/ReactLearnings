Types of Testing
    - Unit Testing (Testing a single component at a time)
    - Integration Testing (Testing a feature which involves multiple components at a time)
    - End to End Testing (Testing the complete flow of the application)


Setting up Testing in our App,
    - Install React Testing Library
    - Install Jest
    - Install Babel Dependencies
    - Configure babel.config.js
    - Configure parcel config file to disable default babel transpilation
    - Jest configuration (npx jest --init)
    - Install JSDOM library
    - Install @babel/preset-react - to make JSX work in test cases
    - Install @babel/preset-react inside my babel config - why install (to convert react jsx code to HTML for the browser to read)
    - Install @testing-library/jest-dom


Basic example to write test cases

    test("sum of two numbers", () => {
        const result = sum(3, 4);

        //Assertion
        expect(result).toBe(7);
    })

If we have more test cases we can group our test cases uisng describe

test and it both can be used to write test cases and no difference between them

To automatically run test when making changes
    - go to package.json
    - Configure in scripts the below 2 points
    - "test": "jest",
    - "watch-test": "jest --watch",
    - run - npm run watch-test 


beforeAll - If you want to do something before executing test cases like cleanup, logging
beforeEach - If you want to do something before executing each test case
afterAll - If you want to do something after executing test cases like cleanup, logging
afterEach - If you want to do something after executing each test case


Assignment

1. What are the different types of testing?
    - Unit Testing (Testing a single component at a time)
    - Integration Testing (Testing a feature which involves multiple components at a time)
    - End to End Testing (Testing the complete flow of the application)

2. What is Enzyme?
    - Enzyme is a JavaScript testing utility library specifically designed for testing React components. It provides a set of convenient methods for working with React components in tests, making it easier to interact with and assert the behavior of components during testing.

    - Enzyme was developed by Airbnb and has become a popular choice for testing React components due to its easy-to-use API and powerful features. It provides different rendering modes and utility functions that simplify the process of testing component rendering, interactions, and state changes.

3. Enzyme Vs React Testing Library?
            Enzyme: Enzyme can be a good choice when you want fine-grained control over rendering and interactions, need to simulate complex scenarios involving state and props, or if you're working with older projects that are already using Enzyme.

            React Testing Library: React Testing Library is a better choice when you want to focus on testing user interactions and behaviors rather than implementation details. It promotes writing tests that more closely resemble how users interact with your app, leading to more maintainable and resilient tests.

4. What is Jest and why do we use it?

    Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook. It's primarily used for testing JavaScript applications, including frontend libraries like React, Vue, and Angular, as well as backend Node.js applications. Jest provides a complete and feature-rich environment for writing, running, and managing tests, making it easier to ensure the quality and reliability of your codebase.

    Here are some key features and reasons why developers use Jest:

        Zero Configuration: Jest comes with sensible defaults and requires minimal configuration to get started. It sets up a test runner, assertion library, and mocking capabilities right out of the box.

        Testing Framework: Jest provides a powerful testing framework that supports various types of tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. It supports a wide range of assertions for verifying code behavior.

        Mocking: Jest includes built-in mocking capabilities that allow you to easily mock modules, functions, and APIs, making it simple to isolate the code you're testing from its dependencies.

        Snapshot Testing: Snapshot testing is a feature of Jest that allows you to capture a snapshot of the rendered output of a component or function and compare it against a saved snapshot. It's particularly useful for detecting unintentional UI changes.

        Asynchronous Testing: Jest simplifies testing asynchronous code by providing utilities like async/await support, Promise mocking, and built-in timers for testing code that involves timeouts and intervals.

        Code Coverage: Jest can generate code coverage reports, helping you identify which parts of your code are tested and which areas need more test coverage.

        Parallel Test Execution: Jest supports parallel test execution, which can significantly speed up the testing process, especially for larger codebases.

        Watch Mode: In watch mode, Jest can automatically rerun tests whenever changes are made to the codebase, allowing for quick feedback during development.

        Custom Configuration: While Jest works well with minimal configuration, it also allows you to customize various aspects of the testing environment, making it suitable for a wide range of projects.

        Community and Documentation: Jest has a large and active community, which means there's ample support and resources available. It also has comprehensive documentation to help you get started and navigate its features.

        Integration with Other Tools: Jest can be integrated with other tools commonly used in the JavaScript ecosystem, such as Babel, webpack, and testing libraries like @testing-library/react and @testing-library/vue.

    Overall, Jest simplifies and streamlines the process of writing and maintaining tests for your JavaScript code, helping you catch bugs early, improve code quality, and confidently refactor your codebase. It's a versatile and widely adopted testing framework in the JavaScript community.
